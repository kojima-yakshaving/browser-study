# Gorushi (ゴルシ)

A toy browser implemented in Python.

## Naming Origin

The name "Gorushi" (ゴルシ) is derived from "Gold Ship". It is inspired by the Umamusume: Pretty Derby character of the same name. Gold Ship is known for her unpredictable and often chaotic personality, which is a fitting metaphor for the journey of building a web browser from scratch. This project, like Gold Ship's antics, is bound to be a wild and unpredictable ride.
